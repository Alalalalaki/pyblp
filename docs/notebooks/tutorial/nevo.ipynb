    "### Theory of Random Coefficients Logit\n",
    "The random coefficients model extends the plain logit model by allowing for correlated tastes for different product characteristics $x_{jt}$.\n",
    "In this  model (indirect) utility is given by:\n",
    "$$u_{ijt} = x_{jt} \\beta_i - \\alpha_i p_{jt} + \\xi_{jt} + \\varepsilon_{ijt}$$\n",
    "The main addition is that $(\\alpha_i,\\beta_i)$ have individual specific subscripts $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional on $\\beta_i$ the individual marketshares follow the same logit form as before. But now we must integrate over heterogeneous individuals to get the aggregate marketshares:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_{jt}(\\alpha,\\beta, \\theta_2) = \\int \\frac{e^{x_{jt} \\beta_i   - \\alpha_i p_{jt}  + \\xi_{jt}}}{\\sum_k e^{x_{kt} \\beta_i   - \\alpha_i p_{jt}  + \\xi_{kt}}} f(\\beta_i,\\alpha_i | \\theta_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this integral needs to be performed numerically. This also means that we can't directly linearize the model. It is common to re-parametrize the model to separate the aspects of mean utility that everyone agrees on: \n",

    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "In order to include random coefficients we need to add a _formula_ for the nonlinear parameters $(X_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the logit case we have the same reserved field names in the __product data__:\n",
    "- __market_ids__ are the unique market identifiers which we subscript $t$.\n",
    "- __product_ids__ are the unique product identifiers which we subscript $j$ (these are optional).\n",
    "- __shares__ specifies the marketshares which need to be between zero and one, and within a __market_id__ $:\\sum_{j} s_{jt} \\leq 1$.\n",
    "- __prices__ are prices $p_{jt}$. These have some special properties and are _always_ treated as endogenous.\n",
    "- __demand_instrumentsX__ are numbered demand instruments. These represent only the _excluded_ instruments. The exogenous regressors in $X_1$ will be added to the set of instruments automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceed with the following steps:\n",
    "1. Load the __product data__ which at a minimum consists of __market_ids__, __shares__, and __prices__ and at least one __demand_instrument__\n",
    "2. Define the _formula_ for the $X_1$ (linear) demand model.\n",
    "    - This formula is a `patsy` style formula.\n",
    "    - It includes a _constant_ by default. To exclude the constant either specify a 0 or a -1.\n",
    "    - To include fixed effects use the __absorb__ option and specify which variable(s) you would like to absorb\n",
    "    - `pyblp` does some model reduction (it will exclude the constant if you include FE's and can prevent colinearity if you include multiple FE's).\n",
    "3. Define a _formula_ for the $X_2$ nonlinear demand model.\n",
    "    - Include only the variables over which we want random coefficients.\n",
    "    - Do not absorb or include fixed effects.\n",
    "    - It will include a random coefficient on the constant (to capture inside good vs. outside good preference) unless you specify not to (with a $0$ or $-1$).\n",
    "4. Define an _integration method_ to solve the integral in (1) from several available options:\n",
    "    - Monte Carlo integration (pseudo-random draws)\n",
    "    - Quadrature with Product Rule\n",
    "    - Sparse Grids Quadrature (see Heiss and Winchel)\n",
    "    - See the  :class:`Integration` for more options.\n",
    "3. Combine the _formulas_ and _product data_ and _integration method_ to construct a class :class:`Problem`.\n",
    "4. Use the :meth:`Problem.solve` method of the :class:`Problem` to estimate paramters.\n",
    "    - By default `pyblp` estimates an unrestricted covariance matrix for all random coefficients\n",
    "    - It is required to specify an initial guess of the _nonlinear parameters_. This serves two purposes: (1) to speed up estimation and (2) any initial guesses of zero indicate to the solver which parameters are restricted to be zero always."

    "\n",

    "1. A mean taste which all individuals agree on $\\overline{\\beta}$: $(K \\times 1)$\n",
    "2. A covariance matrix $\\Sigma$: $(K_2 \\times K_2)$\n",
    "3. Interactions with observed demographic data $D_i$: $(D \\times 1)$ which we label $\\Pi$: $(K_2 \\times D)$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- :meth:`Problem.solve` takes an initial guess of $\\Sigma_0$. It guarantees that $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ (the estimated parameters) have the same sparsity structure as $\\Sigma_0$. Thus any zero element of $\\Sigma_0$ is restricted to be zero in the solution $\\hat{\\Sigma}$. For example, a popular restriction is that $\\Sigma$ is diagonal, this can be achieved by passing a diagonal matrix as $\\Sigma_0$.\n",
    "- As is common with multivariate normal distributions `pyblp` does not estimate $\\Sigma$ directly, rather it estimates it's matrix square root $L$ (Cholesky Root) where $L L' = \\Sigma$"

Absorption of fixed effects yields the same first-stage results as does including them as indicator variables, although results for GMM stages after the first may be slightly different because the two methods can give rise to different weighting matrices.\n",
